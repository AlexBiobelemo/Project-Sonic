# Project-Sonic
This project is a high-fidelity simulation of a real-time anomaly detection system for VPN logs. It uses an unsupervised machine learning model to identify suspicious activity and provides tools for model explainability and interactive feedback, all packaged within a user-friendly Streamlit web application.
